/// - Fetch from origin with --prune
/// - Find branches with remote tracking that are now gone ([origin/branch: gone])
/// - Verify each branch was actually merged into main/master before deletion
/// - Skip main/master/current branches for safety
/// - Only delete branches that had remote tracking history (never touch local-only branches)
/// 
/// Safety requirements:
/// - Never delete local-only branches that were never pushed
/// - Verify merge status before deletion
/// - Provide clear user feedback about what's being deleted and why
